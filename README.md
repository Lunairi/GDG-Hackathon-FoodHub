Hackathon Challenge: Utilize Clover API to allow promote/help merchants in restaurant/store settings (mom & pop shops, retailers, etc) in some way shape or form.

The idea we had was to tackle the ever difficult subject of finding a place to eat when you are craving something. You have to look up "ramen place" or something on google if you want to eat something like Shoyu Ramen. We decided to take advantage of Clover's API where the merchant's inventory is there, and allow merchants to upload their product to a database search engine called FoodHub.

What is FoodHub? Its a hub where users can search up what they want and it will return back the food/name of food and the store/location. This way the users will be able to identify exactly what stores has their craving and they can eat there.

We had a total time limit of 15 hours including breaks/food breaks. You won't be able to test this unless you set this up with a Clover API web app as this is completely integrated. However this is a fully functional prototype.
